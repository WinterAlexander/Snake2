# Snake2
A snake game made in Java with Swing/AWT in 2014. The project have been made with Alexis Mitsler (Boost). Boost did the graphics of the game while I did the code.

It has been called "Snake2" because I've already made a snake game in C 2-3 years before.

This game is REALLY simple, it is one of the first things I ever did in Java. (That is not silly Minecraft development)

A gameplay video is available on youtube:
